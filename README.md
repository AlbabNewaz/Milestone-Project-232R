# Introduction

The following project takes data from Steam reviews and attempts to translate the data into digestible and understandable chunks for meaningful insights. 

# Abstract

This study analyzes a dataset of user reviews extracted from Steam to gain insights into player behavior and review patterns. The dataset includes comprehensive user review data, along with supporting metrics such as playtime, review timing, gameplay hours, and weighted user scores. By examining these key variables, this project seeks to uncover trends in how players engage with games, the relationship between play duration and review sentiment, and the potential impact of review timing on scoring behavior. The findings aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of user feedback dynamics in digital gaming platforms, offering valuable insights for both developers and researchers.
